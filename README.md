Local Weather

Using simple-weather API, this app displays local weather views for today and the week ahead. The app was made using react and styled with Google's Material Design, and inspired by an assignment at freecodecamp.

Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.

Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.

User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
